# GifTastic

I have created a simply tool leveraging JQUERY with the power of an API to quickly search and display sports related Gifs from Giphy.  I have some preset buttons across the the top of the page and have also given you the ability to add more while in your session.  If you click on one of the buttons 10 related Gifs will appear.  If you click on the Gif it will play and by clicking again it will stop.

Add more buttons by entering other sports in the field and click the Add button.  Have fun!
